## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

The simplest way to get started is using the included setup script:

```bash
# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run the setup script
./setup.sh

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Set your Groq API key
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# Alternatively, create a .env file with: GROQ_API_KEY=your_key

# Launch the application
./first_ai.py
```

## üé§ Voice Capabilities

The application offers two tiers of voice interaction:

### Basic Voice Setup
- Voice input via microphone using SpeechRecognition
- Local text-to-speech via pyttsx3
- Configurable speech rate and volume

### Enhanced Cloud TTS
- Higher quality voice output using cloud-based services
- Improved pronunciation of musical terminology
- Better handling of longer text passages

**Note**: PyAudio installation may require additional system packages:
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio`
- **macOS**: `brew install portaudio`
- **Windows**: Typically works with standard pip install

## üéπ Music Notation System

The application leverages music21 and ABC notation for interactive music examples:

- **Dynamic Generation**: Create notation for various musical elements
- **Visual Rendering**: Convert ABC notation in AI responses to graphical notation
- **Customization Options**: Adjust notation parameters for different contexts

For optimal notation rendering, installing MuseScore is recommended:
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install musescore`
- **macOS/Windows**: Download from [MuseScore website](https://musescore.org/)

- `models`: List and select available Groq AI models
- `temp <value>`: Adjust temperature (0.0-1.0) to control AI response creativity

### Topic Management
- `topic`: Select a specialized music topic to focus the conversation

### Session Management
- `save txt`: Export conversation to a text file
- `save pdf`: Export conversation to a PDF document
- `save docx`: Export conversation to a Word document
- `save session`: Preserve the current conversation state to a session file
- `load session`: Restore a previously saved conversation session

### Voice Commands
- `voice input`: Toggle microphone input for speaking your messages
- `voice output`: Read the last AI response aloud using text-to-speech
- `voice settings`: Configure voice output settings (rate, volume)
- `install cloud tts`: Install packages required for high-quality cloud TTS

### Music Notation Commands

## üîÑ Example Workflow

1. Start by selecting a topic: `topic harmony`
2. Ask a question about chord progressions
3. When the AI mentions a chord progression in ABC notation, use `render notation`
4. Use `voice output` to hear the explanation read aloud
5. Save your learning progress with `save session`
6. Export materials with `save pdf` for future reference
